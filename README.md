# Chinese-wordcloud-based-on-image
You can create Chinese wordclouds based on the images which you want to use. The result is based on the shape and color of the original image file. The more the original image file is colorful, the better results would be created. You can adjust the Max and min font size freely for customization.

These examples are my results using txt files of Chinese EV companies.
